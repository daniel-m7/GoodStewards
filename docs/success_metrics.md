# Success Metrics

To measure the success of the project and ensure we are delivering value, we will track the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

### Business & Value Metrics

*   **Total Refund Amount Claimed:** The total dollar amount of sales tax refunds successfully claimed by all non-profits on the platform. This is our primary value metric.
*   **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Total predictable revenue generated from platform subscriptions.
*   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** The average cost to acquire a new paying non-profit organization.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** The total revenue a non-profit is expected to generate throughout its time as a customer. CLV > 3x CAC is a healthy target.
*   **Churn Rate:** The percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions in a given period.

### User Engagement & Adoption Metrics

*   **Adoption Rate:** Percentage of members within a registered non-profit who have activated their account and submitted at least one receipt.
*   **Receipts Processed per Month:** The volume of receipts being processed through the system, indicating active use.
*   **Form Generation Rate:** The number of organizations that successfully generate a Form E-585 each refund cycle.
*   **User Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS):** Regular, simple in-app surveys to gauge treasurer and member satisfaction with the platform.

### Product & Operational Metrics

*   **AI Extraction Accuracy:** The percentage of receipt fields correctly extracted without manual correction by the treasurer.
*   **Average Reimbursement Time:** The average time from when a member submits a receipt to when they receive payment.
*   **Platform Uptime:** The percentage of time the service is available and operational. Target > 99.9%.
