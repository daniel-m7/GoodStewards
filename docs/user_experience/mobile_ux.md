# GoodStewards Mobile App UX and Workflow Plan

## 1. Document Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive plan for the user experience (UX), user flows, and core technical workflow for the member-facing mobile web application. Its purpose is to guide design and development, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience for all user roles. For a broader overview of project epics, use cases, and the overall roadmap, please refer to the [Project Overview](./epics_usecases_roadmap.md) document.

## 2. Target Personas

### 2a. The Non-Profit Member

*   **Who they are:** A member of a non-profit organization who occasionally incurs expenses or makes small donations on its behalf.
*   **Core Motivation:** To contribute to their organization's mission with minimal personal friction.
*   **Key Pain Points:**
    *   Saving physical receipts is inconvenient.
    *   The process of getting reimbursed is slow and requires manual effort (e.g., in-person meetings).
    *   They often don't bother submitting small receipts, which results in lost data and unclaimed tax refunds for their organization.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   A fast, simple "fire-and-forget" way to submit a receipt the moment they get it.
    *   To be reimbursed quickly and electronically.

### 2b. The Non-Profit Treasurer

*   **Who they are:** The financial administrator for the non-profit. They are responsible for collecting all receipts, ensuring compliance, and filing for tax refunds.
*   **Core Motivation:** To maximize the organization's tax refund by capturing every eligible expense, while minimizing the administrative burden on themselves and members.
*   **Key Pain Points:**
    *   Receiving stacks of physical receipts from members who are not tech-savvy or don't want to use an app.
    *   Manually entering data from dozens or hundreds of receipts is tedious and error-prone.
    *   Keeping track of which receipt belongs to which member for reimbursement purposes.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   A way to quickly digitize and submit receipts they receive physically from members, directly from their mobile device.
    *   To easily attribute a submission to the correct member.
    *   To reduce their own data entry workload.

## 3. End-to-End User Journey

The user journey is split into two distinct phases: a one-time onboarding process and the recurring core usage loop.

### Phase 1: Onboarding & Registration (First-Time Use)

This phase allows a prospective member to join an organization. The primary, recommended method is via a secure, single-tap social sign-on (OAuth2), with a traditional email/password option available as a secondary choice.

1.  **Scan QR Code:** The user scans a unique QR code provided by the organization.
2.  **App Store Download:** The QR code directs the user to the appropriate app store to download the GoodStewards mobile app.
3.  **Install & Open App:** The user installs and opens the app, which is pre-configured with the organization's name from the QR code.
4.  **Choose Authentication Method:** The user is presented with a clear choice:
    *   **Primary (Recommended):** "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Apple."
    *   **Secondary:** A smaller option to sign up using their email and a password.
5.  **Create Account:**
    *   **OAuth Flow:** The user authenticates with their chosen provider (Google/Apple). The app receives their name and email, creating the account automatically.
    *   **Password Flow:** The user manually enters their full name, email, and creates a password.
6.  **First Login & Approval:** Upon successful registration, the user is logged in. Their membership status may be `pending` until approved by an organization administrator. They land on the main Dashboard.

### Phase 2: Core Usage Loop (Submitting Receipts)

This is the primary workflow for an authenticated, registered user. The design philosophy is **"Capture and Go."**

1.  **Open App:** The user opens the mobile web app. If their session is active, they land on the Dashboard. If not, they are presented with the Login screen.
2.  **Initiate Submission:** From the Dashboard, the user taps the primary "Add Receipts" button.
3.  **(Treasurer Role Only) Choose Submitter:** If the user has the "Treasurer" role, a modal appears asking who the submission is for.
    *   Option A: "For Myself"
    *   Option B: "On Behalf of a Member"
    *   If they choose "For Myself," the flow continues to step 4.
    *   If they choose "On Behalf of a Member," they are taken to the Member Selection screen (Screen F) before proceeding.
4.  **Capture or Select:** The user is given two clear choices: take new photos with their device camera or select one or more existing receipt images from their photo library.
5.  **Review Selections:** The user is shown thumbnails of all selected receipts, with details like total and sales tax for each. This allows them to spot and remove any accidental selections.
6.  **Choose Submission Type:** Before submitting, the user will be presented with a clear choice: "Reimburse" or "Donate".
7.  **Confirm Submission:** After selecting the submission type, the user reviews a summary of the total expenses and sales tax for all receipts to be redeemed. They then tap a single "Submit" button to confirm. The app immediately begins submitting the images in the background.
8.  **Receive Feedback:** The app provides immediate visual feedback that the submissions are processing. The user can safely navigate away or close the app; the process will continue.
9.  **View Submission:** The new submissions appear at the top of their Dashboard list with a "Pending" status, confirming the action was successful and closing the loop.

## 5. Core Technical Workflow: Receipt Submission

This describes the step-by-step process that occurs when a user hits the "Submit" button.

1.  **User Action:** User taps the "Submit [N] Receipts" button.
2.  **Frontend:** The mobile web app initiates parallel HTTPS POST requests for each selected image file to a secure backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/receipts`). The request header includes the user's JWT authentication token. If the user is a treasurer submitting on behalf of another member, the `member_id` of that member is included in the request body.
3.  **Backend - Initial Ingestion & Validation:**
    *   The API server receives the image files.
    *   It validates the authentication token to identify the user and their associated organization. It checks if the user has the "Treasurer" role if a `member_id` is present.
    *   For each image, it immediately creates a new record in the receipts table in PostgreSQL with a status of `processing`, linking it to `organization_id` and the correct `user_id` (either the treasurer's or the selected member's).
    *   It securely streams the image file to the designated bucket in Cloudflare R2 object storage. The unique storage path (e.g., `org_id/user_id/receipt_uuid.jpg`) is saved to the new database record.
4.  **Backend - Asynchronous AI Processing:**
    *   The backend adds a job to a background queue (e.g., Celery, RQ) for each new receipt ID. This ensures the API can respond quickly to the user without waiting for AI processing.
    *   A worker process picks up the job, retrieves the image URL from the database record.
    *   The worker calls the BAML runtime, which executes a pre-defined function to call Google's Gemini Pro API, sending the image for analysis.
5.  **Backend - Data Persistence:**
    *   The Gemini API returns a structured JSON object containing the extracted vendor, date, total_amount, sales_tax, etc.
    *   The worker process receives this JSON.
    *   It updates the corresponding record in the PostgreSQL receipts table with the extracted data and changes the status from `processing` to `pending` (awaiting treasurer approval).
6.  **Frontend - UI Update:** The member's dashboard, upon being loaded or refreshed, will fetch the latest status for their submissions. For a more advanced experience, a WebSocket connection could push the status update (`processing` â `pending`) to the client in real-time.

## 6. Core Technical Workflow: Feedback Submission

This describes the step-by-step process for feedback submission.

1.  **User Action:** User taps the "Submit Feedback" button.
2.  **Frontend:** The mobile web app or web dashboard sends an HTTPS POST request to a secure backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/feedback`). The request body includes the feedback type, message, and optionally, system information.
3.  **Backend - Ingestion & Persistence:**
    *   The API server receives the feedback data.
    *   It validates the user's authentication token.
    *   It creates a new record in a dedicated `feedback` table in PostgreSQL, storing the feedback type, message, user ID, and any captured system information.
    *   It sends an email notification to the designated support inbox (e.g., `support@goodstewards.app`) with the feedback details.
4.  **Frontend - Confirmation:** The app displays a confirmation message to the user, thanking them for their feedback.
