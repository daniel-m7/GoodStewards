# Project [Your Startup Name] - Non-Profit Sales Tax Refund Automation

## Summary

This project is the foundation for a SaaS platform that automates the process for non-profit organizations in North Carolina to claim refunds on state, county, and transit sales and use taxes. By simplifying receipt submission and automating the generation of official tax forms, we empower non-profits to reclaim significant funds that are often left unclaimed due to tedious manual processes.

## Problem Statement

Non-profit organizations in North Carolina are entitled to a semi-annual sales tax refund. However, the process of collecting receipts, meticulously extracting data, and accurately filling out Form E-585 is complex and labor-intensive. This burden often falls on volunteer treasurers who are short on time, leading to a significant loss of funds for the organization. For a mid-sized non-profit, this can easily amount to thousands of dollars in unclaimed refunds annually. Furthermore, the associated manual expense reimbursement workflow is inefficient, requiring in-person meetings and manual check-writing.

## Proposed Solution

We are building a unified web and mobile application designed to streamline the entire workflow from receipt submission to refund claim.

*   **For Members:** A simple, intuitive mobile application allows members to instantly submit expenses by photographing receipts. The platform handles all data entry and calculations automatically.
*   **For Treasurers:** A secure web dashboard provides a central hub for managing finances. It uses AI to extract data from receipts, categorizes expenses, facilitates a seamless electronic reimbursement workflow, and generates a print-ready Form E-585 with one click.

This solution saves valuable time, eliminates administrative friction, and ensures non-profits maximize their financial resources.
